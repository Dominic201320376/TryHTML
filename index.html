		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>A programming language is a formal constructed language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms.</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>Paradigms</h2>
		<p>A programming paradigm is a fundamental style of computer programming, serving as a way of building the structure and elements of computer programs.</p>
		<h2>Some Paradigms</h2>
		<h3>Functional</h3>
		<p>In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm-a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs-that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.</p>
		<h3>Imperative</h3>
		<p>In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state.</p>
		<h3>Object-oriented</h3>
		<p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which are data structures that contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods.</p>
		<h3>Logic</h3>
		<p>Logic programming is a programming paradigm based on formal logic. A program written in a logic programming language is a set of sentences in logical form, expressing facts and rules about some problem domain. </p>
